# Hotel Revenue Insight Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking and revenue data to uncover performance gaps, identify underperforming properties, and recommend data-driven revenue optimization strategies. The analysis enables stakeholders to make informed pricing, inventory, and channel management decisions.

The dashboard provides an executive-level overview of key hospitality KPIs across cities, properties, room classes, and booking platforms.

## Problem Statement
Hotel chains often struggle with:
- Identifying underperforming properties
- Understanding why certain hotels or room categories generate lower revenue
- Optimizing pricing and channel strategies based on demand patterns

This project addresses these challenges by using structured data analysis and interactive dashboards to surface actionable revenue insights.

## Dataset
- 10,000+ hotel booking and revenue records
- Multiple cities and properties
- Various room classes and booking platforms
- Time-based data for trend and week-over-week analysis

- RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)  
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)  
- Occupancy Percentage  
- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)  
- Realisation Percentage  
- Booking Platform Performance  
- Week-over-Week Trends

## Dashboard Features
- Executive KPI cards for Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy, and Realisation  
- City and room-class level performance filters  
- Platform-wise booking and realisation analysis  
- Property-level comparison to identify underperforming hotels  
- Trend analysis for key metrics over time

## Key Insights
- Identified underperforming hotels across multiple cities based on RevPAR and occupancy trends  
- Discovered pricing inefficiencies and demand-supply mismatches at property level  
- Highlighted platform-level differences in ADR and realisation rates  
- Found strong weekday vs weekend performance variation impacting revenue

## Business Recommendations
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on demand patterns and occupancy levels  
- Optimize channel mix to improve realisation and reduce dependency on low-margin platforms  
- Apply demand-based pricing for peak and off-peak periods  
- Focus inventory and pricing adjustments on consistently underperforming properties
